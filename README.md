# The-Planets

A webapp using HTML, SASS & Javascript.

Initial plan was to use react.js but seems like I wasn't prepared. So instead, used my basic javascript skill to fetch and filter data set em up for html components.
The site isn't well made, not responsive I admit.
Hopefully it's just the beginning
