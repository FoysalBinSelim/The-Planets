 ## **A webapp using HTML, SASS & Javascript.**
 Initial plan was to use react.js but seems like I wasn't fully prepared. So instead, used my basic javascript knowledge. The site isn't well made, not responsive I admit.
 Hopefully it's just the beginning.

## **Things I've learned.**
 Fetching and filtering data and set them up in html components using javascript.

## **Things I want to do.**
 - Use React,js to build teh whole thing
 - Make it device responsive
